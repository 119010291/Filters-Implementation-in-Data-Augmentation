# Filters Implementation in Data Augmentation on Music Emotion Prediction
## MPATE-GE 2607: Digital Signal Theory II final project
This is a repository with all my code for my final project for MPATE-GE 2607: Digital Signal Theory II (New York University, Spring 2024). In this project, I experimented filters in Data Augmentation on Music Emotion Prediction using deep learning method. It includes the project report and code to test out the algorithm.
